## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Students Performance in Exams data to better understand:

1. Factors that contribute to good exam performance 
2. Does gender and ethnicity have any impact on performance?
3. Does the parents level of education has any impact on their child performance ?
4. Does test preparation course course leads to better exam performance?
5. Does the lunch types have any effect on exam performance?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 2 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>
